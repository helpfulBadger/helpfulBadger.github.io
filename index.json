Later on as we start to develop authorization rules it may be handy to have all of the logs aggregated and displayed in one place for your development and troubleshooting activies. In this article we will walk through how to setup the EFK stack to pull your logs together from all of the docker containers in your local development environment. All of the source code for this getting started example is located on github.\nAdding EFK containers We will be using Fluent Bit in this example because it is lite weight and simpler to deal with than Logstash or full fledged FluentD. Below is a gist with a very basic configuration and no special optimizations. Lines 9 and 30 use the depend_on property to cause docker to start elasticSearch first and then the other containers that depend on elasticSearch.\n Wiring our containers into EFK With the log aggregation containers added to our docker-compose file, we now need to wire them into the other containers in our environment. The gist below shows a couple of small changes that we needed to make to our compose file from Getting Started Guide #1. We added the property at line 14 below which expresses our dependency on elasticSeach. Additionally, we need to wire standard out and standard error from our containers to fluentBit. This is done through the logging properties on lines 17 and 27. The driver line tells docker which log driver to use and the tag help make it more clear which container is the source of the logs.\n Taking things for a spin The demonstration script spins everything up for us. Just run ./demonstrate_front_proxy.sh to get things going:\n It downloads and spins up all of our containers. Then it waits 30 seconds to give elasticSearch some time to get ready and some time for Kibana to know that elasticSearch is ready. A curl command sends Envoy a request to make sure the end-to-end flow is working. If that worked, proceed forward. If not wait a bit longer to make sure elasticSearch and Kibana are both ready. If you are running on Mac OS X then the next step will open a browser and take you to the page to setup your Kibana index. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, simply open your browser and go to http://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/management/kibana/index_pattern?_g=() you should see something like this:  I simply used log* as my index and clicked next. Which should bring up a screen to select the timestamp field name. Select @timestamp and click create index. You should see some field information about your newly created index.  The script then uses the Open command to navigate to the log search interface. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work on your operating system then simply navigate to http://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/discover. You should see something like this with some log results already coming in. If you have an interest, you may want to select the container_name and log columns to make it easier to read through the debug logs and results of your testing efforts.  The script sends another request through envoy and you should be able to see the logs coming into EFK.  The script with then take down the environment.  In the next getting started guide, we will add in Open Policy Agent and begin experimenting with a simple authorization rule.\n",

    "title": "Using Envoy as a Front Proxy",
    "date": "August 31, 2020",
    "description": "Learn how to set up Envoy as a front proxy with docker",
    "body": "Photo by Mattia Serrani on Unsplash\nUsing Envoy as a Front Proxy Overview Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy that has become extremely popular as the backbone underneath most of the leading service mesh products (both open source and commercial). This article is intended to demystify it a bit and help people understand how to use it on it\u0026rsquo;s own in a minimalist fashion.\nEnvoy is just like any other proxy. It receives requests and forwards them to services that are located behind it. The 2 ways to deploy Envoy are:\n  Front Proxy - In a front proxy deployment Envoy is very similar to NGINX, HAProxy, or an Apache web server. The Envoy server has it\u0026rsquo;s own IP address and is a separate server on the network from the services that it protects. Traffic comes in and get forwarded to a number of different services that are located behind it. Envoy supports a variety of methods for making routing decisions.\n One mechanism is to use path based routing to determine the service of interest. For instance a request coming in as: /service1/some/other/stuff can use the first uri path element as a routing key. service1 can be used to route requests to service 1. Additionally, service2 in /service2/my/applications/path can be used to route the request to a set of servers that support service 2. The path can be rewritten as it goes through Envoy to trim off the service routing prefix. Another mechanism is to use Server Name Indication (SNI) which is a TLS extension to determine where to forward a request. Using this technique, service1.com/some/other/stuff would use the server name to route to the service1 services. Additionally, service2.com/my/applications/path would use service2.com to route the request to service2. The diagram above shows the front proxy approach.    Sidecar Proxy - In a sidecar deployment, the Envoy server is located at the same IP address as each service that it protects. The Envoy server when deployed as as sidecar only has a single service instance behind it. The sidecar approach can intercept all inbound traffic and optionally all outbound traffic on behalf of the service instance. IP Tables rules are typically used to configure the operating system to capture and redirect this traffic to Envoy. The diagram above shows the sidecar approach.\n  In this article and example project we will start with the simplest possible Envoy deployment. This example just uses docker compose to show how to get Envoy up and running. There will be a number of subsequent articles that expand on this simple approach to demostrate more Envoy capabilies. Open Policy Agent will also be introduced to handle more complex authorization use cases that cannot be handled by Envoy alone.\nThe diagram below shows the environment that we are about to build and deploy locally.\nBuilding an Envoy Front Proxy The code for the complete working example can be found on Github. We will start with the Envoy docker images. The Envoy images are located on Dockerhub. We will use docker-compose to build some configurability into our Envoy environment.\nDockerfile  The entrypoint.sh file is where the magic happens. We will configure environment variables in our docker-compose file to determine which service (SERVICE_NAME) Envoy routes to and the port (SERVICE_PORT) on that service. Additionally, we specify how much detail is captured in the logs by setting the DEBUG_LEVEL environment variable. As you can see from the script below on line 3, we replace those environment variables on the fly in Envoy\u0026rsquo;s configuration file before starting Envoy.\nentrypoint.sh  Since we don\u0026rsquo;t have a configuration file yet, we will cover that next. Envoy is very flexible and powerful. There is an enormous amount of expressiveness that the Envoy API and configuration files support. With this flexibility and power, Envoy configuration files can become quite complicated with a lot layers in the YAML hierarchy. Additionally, each feature has a lot of configuration parameters. The documentation can only cover so much of that functionality with an open source community of volunteers.\nOne of the challenges that I have when reading through the documentation and trying to apply it, is that the documentation has a variety of YAML snippets. There are very few places that these YAML snippets are pulled together into a functioning example. There are a few examples in the source code examples directory but they are far from comprehensive. That leaves a lot of tinkering for engineers to figure out how to compose a functional configuration while interpretting sometimes unclear error messages on their way to the promised land. That is the entire reason that I am writting a series of getting started guides. These articles are intended to give folks a known to work starting point for Envoy authorization features and extensions like Open Policy Agent.\nThe Envoy configuration starts with defining a listener as we can see starting on line 3. The first property is the address and port to accept traffic on (lines 3 through 6). The next property is a filter chain. Filter chains are very powerful and enable configuration for a wide variety of possible behaviors. This filter chain is as simple as it gets. It simply accepts any HTTP traffic with any URI pattern and routes it to the cluster named service.\nThe http_connection_manager component does this for us. It\u0026rsquo;s configuration starts on line 9 and extends to line 24. Execution order is determined by the order they are listed in the configuration file. The important part for this discussion begins on line 14 with the route_config. This sets up routing requests for any domain (line 18) and any request URI that begins with a slash (line 20) to go to the cluster named service. The cluster definitions are in a separate section to make them reusable destination across a variety of rules.\nEnvoy Configuration (envoy.yaml)  The cluster definitions begin on line 25. We can see that there is only a single cluster defined. It has the name service, uses DNS to find server instances and uses round robin to direct traffic across multiple instances. The hostname is on line 32 and the port is on line 33. As we can see these are the environment variables that we will swap out with the entry.sh script.\nThe last section of the configuration file tells Envoy where to listen for admin traffic. The admin gui is a handy little tool that we will not cover in this guide but is definitely worth poking around in to observe what is going on inside an individual Envoy instance.\nDocker Compose Configuration Now that we understand the Envoy configuration we can move on to understanding the rest of the simple environment that we are setting up. Line 4 shows the trigger that causes docker to build the Envoy container. Docker will only build the Envoy Dockerfile the first time it sees that an image does not exist. If you want to force rebuilding the Envoy container on subsequent runs add the --build parameter to your docker compose command. We expose Envoy to the host network on lines 6 and 7 and provide the configuration file that we just created on line 9.\n The service to route to and port are defined on the environment variables on lines 12 and 13. Notice the name app matches the name of our final service on line 15. We are simply using HTTPBIN to reflect our request back to us.\nRunning and Trying out our Example The last step to getting our front proxy up is simply running the included script that demonstrates our example. The script explains what it is about to do to ensure you know what are about to see scrolling across your terminal screen. Line 8 starts our environment. Line 14 let\u0026rsquo;s you check to make sure both containers are running before trying to send them a request.\n Line 19 simply calls Envoy with a curl command with the --verbose parameter set so that you can see the headers and request details. Then line 25 tears down the whole environment.\nContainers UP!!!! If you have successfully started your environment then you should see something like this:\n We Succeeded!!! You should see something like this if you successfully called HTTPBin through Envoy:\n Congratulations Congratulations, you have successully stood up your first Envoy instance and configured it to forward traffic! This is the simplest possible Envoy configuration :) We don\u0026rsquo;t have any security yet or any other features that Envoy is famous for. We will get to that in future articles. Feel free to use postman to explore other request that you can send. Additionally, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to explore Envoy\u0026rsquo;s admin console by pointing your web browser to http://localhost:8001\n",
